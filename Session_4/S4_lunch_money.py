# Exercise 4.4:
#   I want to work out how much money I've spent on lunch this week.
#   I've created a list of what I spent each day.
#   Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the total cost
costs = [8.30, 7.12, 5.01, 1.00, 0.99, 5.92, 3.50]
total_cost = 0

for money in costs:
    total_cost = total_cost + money

print(f"Lunches came to Â£{total_cost:.2f} in total this week")

# Another way
# costs = [8.30, 7.12, 5.01, 1.00, 0.99, 5.92, 3.50]
# total = sum(costs)
# print(f"Total cost = {total:.2f}")
