## :bowtie: Week 1
- `Cat_Food.py` script :cat:
- `HW1_Chair_Nails.py` script from question 1 of the homework :hammer:
- `HW1_Name+Age.py` script from question 2 of the homework :blush:
- `HW1_Omeletes.py` my script from question 3 of the homework :egg:
  - I added a `How many eggs will be leftover?` equation.
  - I added a feature so the user can input the `eggs_per_omelette` and `boxes_of_eggs` from the command line.
  - I then updated `leftover_eggs` to display different outputs depending on if there were or weren't leftover eggs.
